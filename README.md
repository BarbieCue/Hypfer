### About me

I'm a huge fan of adding wifi connectivity to things for no apparent reason.
Also, I really like RGB lights.

Furthermore, I strongly value FOSS, right to repair and the right to use stuff you own however you like without vendor restrictions.

Therefore, this account contains a growing list of projects to uncloud various IoT things as well as other Smarthome stuff

Note that my aim is to help people help themselves by providing the necessary tools to do so.<br/>
I am not here to help you personally, although that might happen occasionally if the request is interesting and/or something isn't easy to find via google/documentation/the code.

When asking me things, it may therefore happen that you don't get the answer you want or no answer at all.<br/>
That usually means that your request was malformed, redundant or plain wrong.
