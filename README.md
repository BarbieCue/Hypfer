### About me

I'm a huge fan of adding wifi connectivity to things for no apparent reason.
Also, I really like RGB lights.

Furthermore, I strongly value FOSS, right to repair and the right to use stuff you own however you like without vendor restrictions.

Therefore, this account contains a growing list of projects to uncloud various IoT things as well as other Smarthome stuff
